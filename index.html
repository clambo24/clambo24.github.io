<!-- It works with the three css files in this folder: example1.css, example2.css and example3.css. -->
<!-- The HTML file defines the structure of the page, and the CSS files define how it looks. -->
<!-- The CSS examples are all designed to work with this page. Try swapping them out on line 29 and see what happens. -->

    Each tag does something different. For example:
        - The <html> tag defines the whole document.
        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

                This chart shows changes in emissions in 2022 were mainly driven by transient differences in demand and temperature. 
                Aviation emissions almost doubled in 2022 compared with 2021; surface transport emissions increased by 3%; and there was a 16% decrease in emissions from homes.
